**Greenify** is a mobile application designed to encourage sustainable practices by analyzing live images and building communities. Users capture photos of their space (balcony, roadside, basement, etc.) and Greenify automatically analyzes the image using Perplexity's Sonar API to suggest suitable plants for that location. The app also connects like-minded people in the locality to create communities for sustainable, economic, and social growth.
