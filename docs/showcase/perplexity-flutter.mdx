# Perplexity Dart & Flutter SDKs

**Perplexity Dart & Flutter SDKs** provide a comprehensive toolkit for integrating Perplexity's AI capabilities into Dart and Flutter applications. Built specifically for the Flutter community, these packages include a lightweight core API client and ready-to-use Flutter widgets with BLoC state management.

## Features

* Type-safe API client with fully typed models and compile-time safety
* Streaming and non-streaming chat completions with real-time response handling
* Support for all Perplexity models (Sonar, Sonar Pro, Deep Research, Reasoning variants)
* Multi-image processing with base64, data URI, and HTTPS URL support
* Ready-to-use Flutter widgets with BLoC state management integration
* Advanced configuration options (temperature, top-p, search filters, domain restrictions)
* Cross-platform support for iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop
* Future-proof design with custom model string support for new Perplexity releases

## Prerequisites

* Dart SDK 2.17.0 or newer
* Flutter SDK 3.0.0 or newer (for Flutter-specific features)
* Perplexity API key from Perplexity API Console
* Basic knowledge of Flutter BLoC pattern for widget integration

## Installation

### For Dart Projects (Core API Only)

```bash
dart pub add perplexity_dart
```

### For Flutter Projects (Full Widget Support)

```bash
flutter pub add perplexity_flutter
```

### Environment variables

```dart
// Add to your app's configuration
const String perplexityApiKey = 'your_perplexity_api_key_here';
```

## Usage

### Core API Integration
- Type-safe client with all Perplexity models (Sonar, Sonar Pro, Deep Research, Reasoning)
- Streaming and non-streaming chat completions
- Multimodal processing with flexible MessagePart system for text + images

### Flutter Widget Layer
- `ChatWrapperWidget` for BLoC state management 
- `PerplexityChatView` for real-time message display
- `PerplexityChatInput` for user interaction handling

## Code Explanation

* Core Layer: Pure Dart API client (`perplexity_dart`) for cross-platform Perplexity API integration
* UI Layer: Flutter widgets (`perplexity_flutter`) with BLoC state management for rapid development
* Type Safety: Fully typed models and responses prevent runtime errors and provide IntelliSense
* Multimodal: Flexible MessagePart system for combining text and images in single requests
* Streaming: Built-in support for real-time chat completions with proper chunk handling
* Architecture: Two-layer design allows lightweight API usage or full Flutter widget integration

## Architecture

### Two-layer design
- **Core (`perplexity_dart`)** - Pure Dart API client for all platforms
- **UI (`perplexity_flutter`)** - Flutter widgets + BLoC state management

Uses flexible MessagePart system for multimodal content combining text and images.
