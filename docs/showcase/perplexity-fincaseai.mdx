**FinCaseAI** is an AI-powered credit dispute assistant that uses Perplexity's Sonar Reasoning API to analyze financial dispute cases and suggest approve/reject decisions with detailed reasoning. It helps analysts by providing fraud detection, sentiment scoring, and urgency assessment for credit card dispute complaints.

## Features

* **Approve/Reject Decision Suggestions** with confidence levels and detailed reasoning
* **Fraud Risk Scoring** using keyword and pattern matching algorithms
* **Sentiment and Urgency Detection** from complaint text analysis
* **Sonar API Integration** for intelligent recommendations and structured reasoning
* **Optional Redis Caching** for improved performance and response times
* **Structured Output** with citations and supporting evidence

## Prerequisites

FinCaseAI sends case descriptions as structured prompts to the **Sonar API**, asking for:

- A decision recommendation (approve/reject)  
- A brief explanation for the judgment  

The API response is parsed and shown alongside internal fraud and sentiment scores for a complete picture.
