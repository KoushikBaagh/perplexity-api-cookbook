## Features

* **Intelligent Product Recommendations** beyond simple spec comparison
* **Priority-Based Value Alignment** (Best Value, Eco‑Friendly, Ethical, Durability, Made in India)
* **Contextual Personalization** (skin type, usage patterns, region, etc.)
* **Structured Research Output** with:
  - Research summary and top recommendations
  - Value alignment with reasoning
  - Pros/Cons and key specifications
  - User sentiment and community insights (Reddit, Quora)
  - Trade‑off analysis and buying tips
* **Transparent Sources** with citations for verification

## Prerequisites

* Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
* Python 3.10+ and pip
* Perplexity API key

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fizakhan90/perplexicart.git
cd perplexicart

# Backend (FastAPI) setup
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend (Next.js) setup
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```ini
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_api_key
```

(Optional) Add any app‑specific settings as needed (cache, region defaults, etc.).

## Usage

1. **Start Backend (FastAPI)**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload  # adapt module:app if your entrypoint differs
   ```

2. **Start Frontend (Next.js)**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open the App**: Visit `http://localhost:3000` and search for a product. Select your priority (e.g., Eco‑Friendly) and add optional context (skin type, region).

## Code Explanation

* **Backend (FastAPI)**: Orchestrates Sonar calls with dynamic prompt engineering based on query, selected priority, and context
* **Structured Outputs**: Enforces a strict JSON schema via `response_format` to ensure consistent UI rendering
* **Live Web Research**: Directs Sonar to search e‑commerce platforms, forums, review blogs, and sustainability reports
* **Semantic Analysis**: Extracts value alignment, pros/cons, sentiment, and cites sources for transparency
* **Frontend (Next.js/React)**: Presents a clear, user‑friendly view of recommendations, trade‑offs, and citations

## How the Sonar API Is Used

PerplexiCart leverages the **Perplexity Sonar API** as its intelligence core, dynamically generating customized prompts based on user inputs like search queries, priorities and context. The API performs comprehensive web research across e-commerce sites, forums, and review platforms, with responses structured in a consistent JSON format. Through semantic analysis, it extracts key product insights including alignment with user priorities, pros/cons, and sentiment - all backed by cited sources. The FastAPI backend processes these structured responses before serving them to the Next.js frontend for a polished user experience.
