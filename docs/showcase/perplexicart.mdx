**Description**  
PerplexiCart is an AI-powered shopping assistant that helps users make *informed* and *value-aligned* purchasing decisions. Powered by the **Perplexity Sonar API**, it analyzes products across the web and delivers structured insights, including prioritized recommendations, pros/cons, trade-off analysis, and user sentiment — all tailored to the user’s stated preferences (e.g. “Eco-Friendly”, “Made in India”, “Durability”, etc.) and context.

**Key Features & Use Cases**
-  Intelligent product recommendations (beyond simple spec comparison)
- Priority-based value alignment (Best Value, Eco-Friendly, Ethical, Durability, Made in India)
-  Contextual personalization (e.g. skin type, usage patterns, region)
- Structured research output:
  - Research summary  
  - Top product recommendations  
  - Value alignment & reasoning  
  - Pros / Cons  
  - Key specifications

**How the Sonar API Is Used**
PerplexiCart integrates the **Perplexity Sonar API** as its core intelligence engine:

-  **Dynamic prompt engineering** — Prompts are customized based on the user’s search query, selected priority, and optional context.
-  **Structured JSON responses** — We enforce a strict JSON schema via the `response_format` parameter to ensure consistent structured output.
- **Live web research** — The API is instructed to search e-commerce platforms, forums (Reddit, Quora), review blogs, and sustainability reports.
- **Semantic analysis** — Extracts product alignment, pros/cons, user sentiment, and cites relevant sources for transparency.
-  **Frontend delivery** — The FastAPI backend parses the structured response and serves it to the Next.js frontend for a clean, user-friendly display.
